# Alphabet Soup Analysis

The purpose of this project is to build and refine a neural network model capable of predicting the success of charity donations.

### Dataset

Charity_data.csv provides various features about organizations and donations, and target variable we are aiming to predict.

### Summary

Based on the results, Model 06 performed the best without overfitting, achieving an accuracy of ~73%, with a loss score of 56%. This project indicates that increasing the number of neurons above 50 and/or increasing layers above 1, only affects the model marginally.
